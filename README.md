# ENEL369_AMReceiverProject

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Using your knowledge of amplifier circuits, design an AM receiver system, consisting of active filter, envelope detection, baseband amplifier, and output buffer circuits. Use NI Multisim to simulate the design.

### Project Objective

The project objectives included:

1. To analyze and understand different system design perspectives of an amplitude modulation (AM) receiver.
2. To design and implement an AM receiver system.
3. To test and evaluate the performances of the developed AM receiver system using NI Multiism, by probing different signals at different points of the circuit.

## Technologies

The technologies used include:

1. NI Multisim

## Launch

In order to test and simulate the project, NI Multisim 14 is needed.
