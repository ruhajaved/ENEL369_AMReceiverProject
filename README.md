# ENEL369_AMReceiverProject

## Introduction

### Problem Statement

Using knowledge of amplifier circuits, iteratively design an AM receiver system, consisting of active filter, envelope detection, baseband amplifier, and output buffer circuits. Use NI Multisim to simulate the design, and use the project questions provided to drive developement and record results.

### Project Objective

The project objectives included:

1. To analyze and understand different system design perspectives of an amplitude modulation (AM) receiver.
2. To design and implement an AM receiver system.
3. To test and evaluate the performances of the developed AM receiver system using NI Multiism, by probing different signals at different points of the circuit.

## Technologies

The technologies used include:

1. NI Multisim

## Launch

In order to test and simulate the project, NI Multisim 14 is needed.

Then, simply open file Proj-C-1.ms14 in the Simulation folder. Press the go button and look at the oscilliscope attached to the output. It should resemble a sinusoidal wave.

## Possible Improvements

Possible improvements for this project include:

N/A
